  abstract  = {As the world moves to digital storage for archival purposes, there is an increasing demand for systems that can provide secure data storage in a cost-effective manner. By identifying common chunks of data both within and between files and storing them only once, deduplication can yield cost savings by increasing the utility of a given amount of storage. Unfortunately, deduplication exploits identical content, while encryption attempts to make all content appear random; the same content encrypted with two different keys results in very different ciphertext. Thus, combining the space efficiency of deduplication with the secrecy aspects of encryption is problematic.We have developed a solution that provides both data security and space efficiency in single-server storage and distributed storage systems. Encryption keys are generated in a consistent manner from the chunk data; thus, identical chunks will always encrypt to the same ciphertext. Furthermore, the keys cannot be deduced from the encrypted chunk data. Since the information each user needs to access and decrypt the chunks that make up a file is encrypted using a key known only to the user, even a full compromise of the system cannot reveal which chunks are used by which users.},

  abstract     = {Media failures usually leave database systems unavailable for several hours until recovery is complete, especially in applications with large devices and high transaction volume. Previous work introduced a technique called single-pass restore, which increases restore bandwidth and thus substantially decreases time to repair. Instant restore goes further as it permits read/write access to any data on a device undergoing restore – even data not yet restored – by restoring individual data segments on demand. Thus, the restore process is guided primarily by the needs of applications, and the observed mean time to repair is effectively reduced from several hours to a few seconds. This paper presents an implementation and evaluation of instant restore. The technique is incrementally implemented on a system starting with the traditional ARIES design for logging and recovery. Experiments show that the transaction latency perceived after a media failure can be cut down to less than a second. The net effect is that a few “nines” of availability are added to the system using simple and low-overhead software techniques.},

  abstract     = {In data stream applications, a query is created using a series of operators connected by unidirectional pipelines. Since those operators may be deployed in a shared-nothing distributed environment, it is necessary to have a valid restore point in case an operator fails. This ensures consistency of the states among operators after recovering from failures. Typical fault-tolerant approaches periodically capture global snapshots, encompassing all operator states. In the recovery process, all operators must be reinstated to the most recent global snapshot. This global dependency affects the recovery performance and the required computational costs for recovery. We propose fault-tolerant schemes for stateful stream processing that localizes recovery to a subset of operators. Additionally, we introduce a partial snapshot mechanism to capture the states required for local recovery efficiently. This snapshot records only a subset of operator states instead of global states. Our implemented recovery schemes in Apache Flink show improved recovery times by up to more than 50 percent.},
